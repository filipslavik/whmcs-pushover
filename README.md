## WHMCS Pushover (pushover.net) Notifications
Author: Myles McNamara (get@smyl.es)

### Description

This is an addon module for WHMCS (whmcs.com) to send push notifications using the Pushover API.

Currently the only working feature is high priority notification for a new support ticket being opened.  There are many other features and configurable options planned which are listed below.

This release is still in beta stages so use at your own risk.  Tested working on WHMCS 5.2.1 and WHMCS 5.3.1 Beta.
